# Ferdium snippets

> Collection of snippets I use on Ferdium.

This repository contains some styles I use on services on Ferdium, mainly to hide unwanted elements.

I use them on Ferdium myself, nevertheless these snippets are mere standard CSS code, so you may use them on any application (for example your web browser using [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)).
